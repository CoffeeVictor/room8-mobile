To run the development environment you need NodeJS installed on your machine (yarn also recommended)

Then you must have Expo Cli installed globally with `npm i -g expo-cli`

Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies

Run `yarn start`, `npm run start` or `expo start` to run the dev server
